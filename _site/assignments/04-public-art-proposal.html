        <h1>Public Art Proposal</h1>
     
        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Sheridan College has (hypothetically) announced an initiative that invites students to submit proposals for “art interventions” that will be installed in and around the Trafalgar campus.</p>

<p>The art interventions should use 3-dimensional objects (sculptures), possibly augmented by 2-dimensional expression (large-scale graphics), and are to be environmental in scale — that is, they should seek to transform and change the public’s perception of an entire space such as a lobby, corridor, courtyard, parking lot, etc. Of particular interest are the ‘left over’ spaces around the school (such as the paved or grass areas in between buildings) that are currently neglected and void of interest.</p>

<p>In terms of ‘style’, the artwork should explore abstract modernism. Choose one of the following 3 themes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Planar compositions that explore aspects of space and time.</li>
  <li>Stick constructions whose form are both object and enclosure.</li>
  <li>Block assemblages that depict the world in ‘8-bit’ resolution.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/img/planar.jpg" alt="examples of planar design" />
Example of Planar compositions</p>

<p><img src="/img/sticks.jpg" alt="examples of Stick constructions" />
Example of Stick constructions</p>

<p><img src="/img/pixel.jpg" alt="examples of Block assemblages" />
Example of Block assemblages</p>

<p>Use InDesign (or Illustrator) to compose the layout of a Proposal Document as a multi-page spread designed for print. The images and graphics depicting your art installation must be produced using digital media (Photoshop, Illustrator, SketchUp, etc.), with the exception of handsketched line drawings, which may be scanned in and then rendered digitally.</p>

<p>Experimentation with and employment of 3D software (Sketchup, Blender, 3D Studio, etc.) is strongly encouraged.</p>

<p>You may work in teams of two.</p>

<h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>

<p>The requirements for the Proposal Document are as follows:</p>

<p>One 11” × 17” printed page that should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>project title &amp; subtitle(s)</li>
  <li>suggested location(s)</li>
  <li>artist name(s)</li>
  <li>month/year of production</li>
  <li>inspirational graphics</li>
  <li>perspective image (sketch, rendering, collage, or combination thereof) of the installation from the vantage point of the intended audience</li>
  <li>additional diagrams or sketches that augment and/or clarify visual aspects of the work</li>
  <li>textual descriptions that convey the intent, ideas and narratives inherent in the proposed intervention</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>

<p>Printed Proposal Document, as specified above.</p>

<p>Additionally, you must upload your final project to Slate. The project should be contained in a ZIP file named <code class="highlighter-rouge">LastName-FirstName-proposal</code> and should include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>One packaged InDesign folder (File &gt; Package) that contains the InDesign file along with all linked images and fonts.</li>
  <li>One High Quality Print PDF file</li>
</ul>

<p>If working in teams of two, please use <code class="highlighter-rouge">Lastname-Lastname-proposal</code></p>

<p>Only relevant files should be in the folder. This means no unnecessary source files, etc.–keep the file as small as possible for your own sanity when uploading.</p>

     
        <h2>Rubric</h2>

<p>This assignment is due at the start of class <strong>Week 14</strong> and is worth <strong>20%</strong> of your final grade.</p>

<h3>Suggested Textbook</h3>

<p>Above the Fold by Brian Miller (ISBN: 978-1440308420)</p>

<h2>Course Policies</h2>

<h3>Assignments and Late Submissions</h3>

<p>Written work will be assessed not only on the quality of the content, but also on spelling and grammar, and professional language.</p>

<p>Late submissions for Weekly Activities unless a student has submitted a request for accommodation in the policy described in the outline.</p>

<p>Late submissions for the Web page and Web site projects will receive a deduction of 3% for every 24 hours it is late until 7 days (including weekend and holidays) after the due date. At this time, assignments will no longer be accepted (unless a student has submitted a request for accommodation in the policy described in the outline).</p>

<p>Deadline extensions for technical issues, such as computer failure, will not be accepted.</p>

<h3>Academic Regulations (Attendance, Coursework, Tests/Exams)*</h3>

<p>In accordance to <a href="http://academiccalendars.romcmaster.ca/content.php?catoid=7&amp;navoid=559">McMaster University’s General Academic Regulations</a>, “it is imperative that students make every effort to meet the originally scheduled course requirements and it is a student’s responsibility to write examinations as scheduled.” Therefore, all students are expected to attend and complete the specific course requirements (i.e. attendance, assignments, and tests/exams) listed in the course outline on or by the date specified.  </p>

<ol>
<li>Students who need to arrange for <strong>coursework accommodation</strong>, as a result of medical, personal or family reasons, must contact the <strong>course instructor</strong> within five (5) days of the originally scheduled due date. </li>
<li>Students who need to arrange for <strong>a deferred test and/or examination</strong> must contact the <strong>program manager</strong> within five (5) days of the originally scheduled test/exam</li>
</ol>

<p>Failure to abide by the above procedures within the specified five (5) day window will result in a grade of zero (0) on the coursework/exam and no further consideration will be granted.  </p>

<p><em>*Note: Supporting documentation will be required but will not ensure approval of accommodation(s).</em> </p>

<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>

<p>You are expected to exhibit honesty and use ethical behaviour in all aspects of the learning process. Academic credentials you earn are rooted in principles of honesty and academic integrity. </p>

<p>Academic dishonesty is to knowingly act or fail to act in a way that result or could result in unearned academic credit or advantage. This behaviour can result in serious consequences, e.g. the grade of zero on an assignment, loss of credit with a notation on the transcript (notation reads: “Grade of F assigned for academic dishonesty”), and/or suspension or expulsion from the university. </p>

<p>It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes academic dishonesty. For information on the various types of academic dishonesty, please refer to the Academic Integrity Policy, located at <a href="http://www.mcmaster.ca/academicintegrity">http://www.mcmaster.ca/academicintegrity</a></p>

<p>The following illustrates only three forms of academic dishonesty: </p>

<ol>
<li>Plagiarism, e.g. the submission of work that is not one’s own or for which other credit has been obtained. </li>
<li>Improper collaboration in group work. </li>
<li>Copying or using unauthorized aids in tests and examinations. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Academic Accommodations</h2>
