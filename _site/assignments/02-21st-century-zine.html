        <h1>21st Century Zine</h1>
     
        <p>Now that you have spent some time dealing with the printed page, lets turn the page into something digital–something interactive. Let’s build a zine for the 21st Century!</p>

<p><em>What’s a zine!?!</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A zine is usually a non–commercial, non professional publication, kind of like a magazine but with a twist. The main difference between a magazine and a zine is that zines are not out there to make a profit but, rather, to add other, often unheard voices into the mix. Zines are usually made out of interest and passion and are often self-published by the writer/artist/creator.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>…</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many of the first zines were science fiction fanzines created in the 1920s and 1930s through which science fiction fans would speculate and discuss various topics. Later on, in the 1950s with the Beatnik era, poets and other artists would make small leaflets with their poems as means of self promotion. Many avant-garde movements, including the Dadaists and the Situationists, also self-published pamphlets and manifestos. The 70s saw punk zines being created as part of the punk movement and in the spirit of the DIY (do it yourself) culture that came along with it. In the 80s, a zine called Factsheet 5 began reviewing zines, thus creating a somewhat more formal zine scene. In the 90s, many zines were made as part of the Riot Grrl movement.</p>

<h2 id="the-zine">The Zine</h2>

<p>Create a zine about something that interests you by incorporating text and image as you see fit. Images can be anything you want–artwork, photographs, even borrowed graphics from the Web (cited, of course). The aesthetic doesn’t have to be your “typical” cut &amp; paste zine–it can be more “designy”, a photo book, graphic novel, choose-your-own-adventure, children’s book,or anything you think would lend itself well to an interactive PDF.</p>

<p>The zine about must be <em>at least</em> 12 pages long, otherwise, format is up to you. The finished document must be a digital interactive PDF (images @72DPI, RGB colours, links, etc.).</p>

<h3 id="design-considerations">Design considerations</h3>

<p>Beyond the standard images &amp; text, some other aspects of the catalogue should not be overlooked. You may wish to include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cover page(s)</li>
  <li>Table of contents</li>
  <li>Page numbers</li>
  <li>Page bleeds (there is no cropping here)</li>
  <li>Links</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="resources">Resources</h3>

  <li><a href="http://zinesforlunch.blogspot.ca/">Zines for Lunch: the OCAD Zine Library</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="animated-gif">Animated GIF</h2>

<p>Once your zine is complete, you will also create a separate Animated GIF that can be used to advertise your zine on Web sites, discussion boards, even in email. The animated GIF should be no larger than 600px × 600px and between 2–12 seconds long. The style of the GIF is completely up to you (frame animation, cinemagraph, etc.), but should be aesthetically cohesive with the zine.</p>

<p>The Animated GIF and zine are weighted equally, so do not leave the GIF to become an “afterthought”.</p>

<h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>

<p>Submit the interactive PDF and a copy of the animated GIF as a ZIP to Slate with the filename <code class="highlighter-rouge">Lastname-Firstname-zine.zip</code></p>

     
        <h2>Rubric</h2>

<p>This assignment is due at the start of class <strong>Week 08</strong> and is worth <strong>40%</strong> of your final grade.</p>

<ul><li>Typography </li>
<li>Lists &amp; tables </li>
<li>Links </li>
<li>Colour &amp; images </li>
<li>Page layout </li></ul></li>

<h2>Course Format and Methods of Learning</h2>

<p>There will be 14 weekly modules for the course. Each module will contain the instructor’s presentation, required readings, supplemental readings, discussion questions and other learning activities as selected by the instructor. All learners in the course are expected to read the required readings, discuss key concepts via discussion forum topics and to bring relevant examples and/or research to the course learning activities. Please consult the Course Schedule for specific topics and activities.</p>

<h2>Readings</h2>

<p>Course readings are located within the course textbook and/or posted online to the course site. Learners are expected to complete the required readings as a guide to acquire, understand and build upon the presented concepts, theories and practice of Web design. Supplemental readings also allow learners to build personal understanding and viewpoints of specific topics related to the course content.</p>

<h3>Required Textbook</h3>

<p>HTML &amp; CSS: Design and Build Websites by Jon Duckett (ISBN: 978-1-118-00818-8) <em>Note: A physical copy is provided to all learners.</em></p>

<h3>Suggested Textbook</h3>

<p>Above the Fold by Brian Miller (ISBN: 978-1440308420)</p>

<h2>Course Policies</h2>

<h3>Assignments and Late Submissions</h3>

<p>Written work will be assessed not only on the quality of the content, but also on spelling and grammar, and professional language.</p>

<p>Late submissions for Weekly Activities unless a student has submitted a request for accommodation in the policy described in the outline.</p>

<p>Late submissions for the Web page and Web site projects will receive a deduction of 3% for every 24 hours it is late until 7 days (including weekend and holidays) after the due date. At this time, assignments will no longer be accepted (unless a student has submitted a request for accommodation in the policy described in the outline).</p>

<p>Deadline extensions for technical issues, such as computer failure, will not be accepted.</p>

<h3>Academic Regulations (Attendance, Coursework, Tests/Exams)*</h3>

<p>In accordance to <a href="http://academiccalendars.romcmaster.ca/content.php?catoid=7&amp;navoid=559">McMaster University’s General Academic Regulations</a>, “it is imperative that students make every effort to meet the originally scheduled course requirements and it is a student’s responsibility to write examinations as scheduled.” Therefore, all students are expected to attend and complete the specific course requirements (i.e. attendance, assignments, and tests/exams) listed in the course outline on or by the date specified.  </p>

<ol>
<li>Students who need to arrange for <strong>coursework accommodation</strong>, as a result of medical, personal or family reasons, must contact the <strong>course instructor</strong> within five (5) days of the originally scheduled due date. </li>
<li>Students who need to arrange for <strong>a deferred test and/or examination</strong> must contact the <strong>program manager</strong> within five (5) days of the originally scheduled test/exam</li>
</ol>

<p>Failure to abide by the above procedures within the specified five (5) day window will result in a grade of zero (0) on the coursework/exam and no further consideration will be granted.  </p>

<p><em>*Note: Supporting documentation will be required but will not ensure approval of accommodation(s).</em> </p>

<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>

<p>You are expected to exhibit honesty and use ethical behaviour in all aspects of the learning process. Academic credentials you earn are rooted in principles of honesty and academic integrity. </p>

<p>Academic dishonesty is to knowingly act or fail to act in a way that result or could result in unearned academic credit or advantage. This behaviour can result in serious consequences, e.g. the grade of zero on an assignment, loss of credit with a notation on the transcript (notation reads: “Grade of F assigned for academic dishonesty”), and/or suspension or expulsion from the university. </p>

<p>It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes academic dishonesty. For information on the various types of academic dishonesty, please refer to the Academic Integrity Policy, located at <a href="http://www.mcmaster.ca/academicintegrity">http://www.mcmaster.ca/academicintegrity</a></p>

<p>The following illustrates only three forms of academic dishonesty: </p>

<ol>
<li>Plagiarism, e.g. the submission of work that is not one’s own or for which other credit has been obtained. </li>
<li>Improper collaboration in group work. </li>
<li>Copying or using unauthorized aids in tests and examinations. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Academic Accommodations</h2>
