        <h1>Calendar</h1>
     
        <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Using only images and material created by you, design a letter sized (8.5” × 11”) calendar for print with InDesign. You are expected to use a master page and guides for your initial layout, as well as paragraph &amp; character styles and swatches to manage the appearance. The calendar does not have to be based on months, but should cover at least an entire calendar year.</p>

<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Make the calendar for next year and you’ve got gifts and Etsy items ready to go!</p>

<p>Imagery should be your own (no Google searches, please) and should be edited appropriately for print (300 DPI, CYMK).</p>

<p>Creativity and well-planned concepts will be rewarded.</p>

<h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>

<p>Create a folder entitled <code class="highlighter-rouge">Lastname-Firstname-Calendar</code> and include both the digital Package (your InDesign assets) and an exported PDF (<code class="highlighter-rouge">Lastname-Firstname-Calendar.pdf</code>) with the printer marks included. Submit the folder as ZIP to Slate.</p>

<h2>Course Format and Methods of Learning</h2>

<p>There will be 14 weekly modules for the course. Each module will contain the instructor’s presentation, required readings, supplemental readings, discussion questions and other learning activities as selected by the instructor. All learners in the course are expected to read the required readings, discuss key concepts via discussion forum topics and to bring relevant examples and/or research to the course learning activities. Please consult the Course Schedule for specific topics and activities.</p>

<h2>Readings</h2>

<p>Course readings are located within the course textbook and/or posted online to the course site. Learners are expected to complete the required readings as a guide to acquire, understand and build upon the presented concepts, theories and practice of Web design. Supplemental readings also allow learners to build personal understanding and viewpoints of specific topics related to the course content.</p>

<h3>Required Textbook</h3>

<h3>Suggested Textbook</h3>

<p>Above the Fold by Brian Miller (ISBN: 978-1440308420)</p>

<h2>Course Policies</h2>

<h3>Assignments and Late Submissions</h3>

<p>Written work will be assessed not only on the quality of the content, but also on spelling and grammar, and professional language.</p>

<p>Late submissions for Weekly Activities unless a student has submitted a request for accommodation in the policy described in the outline.</p>

<p>Late submissions for the Web page and Web site projects will receive a deduction of 3% for every 24 hours it is late until 7 days (including weekend and holidays) after the due date. At this time, assignments will no longer be accepted (unless a student has submitted a request for accommodation in the policy described in the outline).</p>

<p>Deadline extensions for technical issues, such as computer failure, will not be accepted.</p>

<h3>Academic Regulations (Attendance, Coursework, Tests/Exams)*</h3>

<p>In accordance to <a href="http://academiccalendars.romcmaster.ca/content.php?catoid=7&amp;navoid=559">McMaster University’s General Academic Regulations</a>, “it is imperative that students make every effort to meet the originally scheduled course requirements and it is a student’s responsibility to write examinations as scheduled.” Therefore, all students are expected to attend and complete the specific course requirements (i.e. attendance, assignments, and tests/exams) listed in the course outline on or by the date specified.  </p>

<ol>
<li>Students who need to arrange for <strong>coursework accommodation</strong>, as a result of medical, personal or family reasons, must contact the <strong>course instructor</strong> within five (5) days of the originally scheduled due date. </li>
<li>Students who need to arrange for <strong>a deferred test and/or examination</strong> must contact the <strong>program manager</strong> within five (5) days of the originally scheduled test/exam</li>
</ol>

<p>Failure to abide by the above procedures within the specified five (5) day window will result in a grade of zero (0) on the coursework/exam and no further consideration will be granted.  </p>

<p><em>*Note: Supporting documentation will be required but will not ensure approval of accommodation(s).</em> </p>

<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>

<p>You are expected to exhibit honesty and use ethical behaviour in all aspects of the learning process. Academic credentials you earn are rooted in principles of honesty and academic integrity. </p>

<p>Academic dishonesty is to knowingly act or fail to act in a way that result or could result in unearned academic credit or advantage. This behaviour can result in serious consequences, e.g. the grade of zero on an assignment, loss of credit with a notation on the transcript (notation reads: “Grade of F assigned for academic dishonesty”), and/or suspension or expulsion from the university. </p>

<p>It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes academic dishonesty. For information on the various types of academic dishonesty, please refer to the Academic Integrity Policy, located at <a href="http://www.mcmaster.ca/academicintegrity">http://www.mcmaster.ca/academicintegrity</a></p>

<p>The following illustrates only three forms of academic dishonesty: </p>

<ol>
<li>Plagiarism, e.g. the submission of work that is not one’s own or for which other credit has been obtained. </li>
<li>Improper collaboration in group work. </li>
<li>Copying or using unauthorized aids in tests and examinations. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Academic Accommodations</h2>

<p>Students with disabilities who require academic accommodations must contact the Student Accessibility Centre (SAS) to meet with an appropriate Disability Services Coordinator. To contact SAS, phone 905-525-9140 ext. 28652, or email<a href="mailto:sas@mcmaster.ca">sas@mcmaster.ca</a>.
