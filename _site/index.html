        <h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>

<p>This course incorporates the foundational principles of web design with experiential activities relevant to the process of designing, producing static Web sites. These principles form the basis for knowledge and skills threaded throughout the subsequent program courses. The importance of design elements, accessibility, usability and functionality will be examined to demonstrate how they affect visual and text content. Application activities involving HTML5, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and web design industry tools such as code editing and image manipulating software will launch the student’s professional portfolio project.</p>

<p>I can be reached at <a href="pricer@mcmaster.ca">pricer@mcmaster.ca</a> and will reply within 24 hours except on the weekends.</p>

<p>Emailing me the night before an assignment is due, will not likely get the desired response time, so stay on top of work to ensure your questions do not go unanswered.</p>

<p>If you cannot make it to class, please let me know as soon as possible so we can make arrangements to get you caught up.</p>

<h2>Assignments</h2>

<p>All major assignments are to be completed for the end of class on the date assigned unless noted otherwise. Specifics for each assignment will be provided as the term progresses.</p>

<p><strong>A final grade for this course is based on the following assignments:</strong></p>

<h2>Course Objectives</h2>

<p>Upon completion of this course, students will:</p>

<ul>
<li>Apply basic web design elements and principles through HTML5 and CSS to communicate content when creating a web page. This includes:
<ul><li>Typography </li>
<li>Lists &amp; tables </li>
<li>Links </li>
<li>Colour &amp; images </li>
<li>Page layout </li></ul></li>
<li>Use a variety of web design tools and software to create and manipulate web design content.</li>
<li>Apply basic user-centered elements and principles to create effective site navigation. This includes:
<ul><li>Accessibility</li>
<li>Usability</li>
<li>Functionality</li></ul></li>
<li>Plan and organize proper file structures to facilitate management of site content.</li>
<li>Create a portfolio website to share current and future web design work with others.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Course Format and Methods of Learning</h2>

<p>There will be 14 weekly modules for the course. Each module will contain the instructor’s presentation, required readings, supplemental readings, discussion questions and other learning activities as selected by the instructor. All learners in the course are expected to read the required readings, discuss key concepts via discussion forum topics and to bring relevant examples and/or research to the course learning activities. Please consult the Course Schedule for specific topics and activities.</p>

<h2>Readings</h2>

<p>Course readings are located within the course textbook and/or posted online to the course site. Learners are expected to complete the required readings as a guide to acquire, understand and build upon the presented concepts, theories and practice of Web design. Supplemental readings also allow learners to build personal understanding and viewpoints of specific topics related to the course content.</p>

<h3>Required Textbook</h3>

<p>HTML &amp; CSS: Design and Build Websites by Jon Duckett (ISBN: 978-1-118-00818-8) <em>Note: A physical copy is provided to all learners.</em></p>

<h3>Suggested Textbook</h3>

<p>Above the Fold by Brian Miller (ISBN: 978-1440308420)</p>

<h2>Course Policies</h2>

<h3>Assignments and Late Submissions</h3>

<p>Written work will be assessed not only on the quality of the content, but also on spelling and grammar, and professional language.</p>

<p>Late submissions for Weekly Activities unless a student has submitted a request for accommodation in the policy described in the outline.</p>

<p>Late submissions for the Web page and Web site projects will receive a deduction of 3% for every 24 hours it is late until 7 days (including weekend and holidays) after the due date. At this time, assignments will no longer be accepted (unless a student has submitted a request for accommodation in the policy described in the outline).</p>

<p>Deadline extensions for technical issues, such as computer failure, will not be accepted.</p>

<h3>Academic Regulations (Attendance, Coursework, Tests/Exams)*</h3>

<p>In accordance to <a href="http://academiccalendars.romcmaster.ca/content.php?catoid=7&amp;navoid=559">McMaster University’s General Academic Regulations</a>, “it is imperative that students make every effort to meet the originally scheduled course requirements and it is a student’s responsibility to write examinations as scheduled.” Therefore, all students are expected to attend and complete the specific course requirements (i.e. attendance, assignments, and tests/exams) listed in the course outline on or by the date specified.  </p>

<ol>
<li>Students who need to arrange for <strong>coursework accommodation</strong>, as a result of medical, personal or family reasons, must contact the <strong>course instructor</strong> within five (5) days of the originally scheduled due date. </li>
<li>Students who need to arrange for <strong>a deferred test and/or examination</strong> must contact the <strong>program manager</strong> within five (5) days of the originally scheduled test/exam</li>
</ol>

<p>Failure to abide by the above procedures within the specified five (5) day window will result in a grade of zero (0) on the coursework/exam and no further consideration will be granted.  </p>

<p><em>*Note: Supporting documentation will be required but will not ensure approval of accommodation(s).</em> </p>

<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>

<p>You are expected to exhibit honesty and use ethical behaviour in all aspects of the learning process. Academic credentials you earn are rooted in principles of honesty and academic integrity. </p>

<p>Academic dishonesty is to knowingly act or fail to act in a way that result or could result in unearned academic credit or advantage. This behaviour can result in serious consequences, e.g. the grade of zero on an assignment, loss of credit with a notation on the transcript (notation reads: “Grade of F assigned for academic dishonesty”), and/or suspension or expulsion from the university. </p>

<p>It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes academic dishonesty. For information on the various types of academic dishonesty, please refer to the Academic Integrity Policy, located at <a href="http://www.mcmaster.ca/academicintegrity">http://www.mcmaster.ca/academicintegrity</a></p>

<p>The following illustrates only three forms of academic dishonesty: </p>

<ol>
<li>Plagiarism, e.g. the submission of work that is not one’s own or for which other credit has been obtained. </li>
<li>Improper collaboration in group work. </li>
<li>Copying or using unauthorized aids in tests and examinations. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Academic Accommodations</h2>

<p>Students with disabilities who require academic accommodations must contact the Student Accessibility Centre (SAS) to meet with an appropriate Disability Services Coordinator. To contact SAS, phone 905-525-9140 ext. 28652, or email<a href="mailto:sas@mcmaster.ca">sas@mcmaster.ca</a>. For further information, consult McMaster University’s Policy for Academic Accommodation for Students with Disabilities. </p>
