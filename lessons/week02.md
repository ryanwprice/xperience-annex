## Content Module Overview

In Module 1 we learned how to format HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and its relationship to CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). Good code is the foundation to a good site, and good content is what attracts users to the site; they say that “Web Design is 95% typography” This module will focus on creating semantic code and applying typographic style to that content.
