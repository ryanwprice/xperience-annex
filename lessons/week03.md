## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this module, students will:

- apply a typographical and semantic hierarchy to HTML markup 
- learn appropriate CSS properties for formatting type on the Web
- learn the limitations of type on the Web: Web-safe & font alternatives (images replacement, Webfonts, etc.), kerning, ligatures, and other CSS3 implementations.

## Topics

- Typography limitations of the Web
- CSS formatting for type
- Font alternatives

## Content Module Overview

In Module 2 we learned how to make our type aesthetically pleasing and readable for the user. Now that we have the design skills, we have to learn the code needed to implement our designs. Styling type on the Web isn’t the same as for print, so we will need to learn about the limitations the Internet imposes on our designs.
