This assignment is designed to test your knowledge on layout concepts and help you practice the new CSS elements we have discussed.

- Font: Courier/Courier New, 20px, bold, white
- Border: 10px thick
- Colours: pure red, pure green, pure blue, pure black, pure white
- Spacing: Boxes should sit 100px from the top of the browser, and the group of boxes centred horizontally, regardless of browser size

## Tips

- You do not need to adjust the HTML in _any_ way!
