## Instructions

Using Photoshop’s `Save for Web` options, save the included illustration, by artist Carla Corrales, and save it as a PNG, JPG, GIF, etc. at various qualities. Assess the image for quality and file size and decide which settings would create the best overall output (remember to find that compromise between quality and file size).

Submit a PDF or Word Doc with your chosen image settings and your justifications for choosing these settings.

If you don’t have Photoshop, you have a couple of options:

1. Download a 30-day trial of Photoshop from Adobe.com
2. Use another image editing application and save the files using the `Save As` feature. Save the image as different file formats and compare.

If you need any help with software, get in touch!
