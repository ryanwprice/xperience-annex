## Try it out

Now that you've struggled with relative paths, let's do things the easy
way!

It is important to know how to figure out relative paths, but sometimes
our head's aren't screwed on tight, or we simply don't have time or
patience to work it out. Fortunately, Brackets has some easy ways to
take care of linking pages, files, and images for us without the
headaches of path structures.

Grab the [links-followup.zip]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/links-followup.zip) and let's build the links the easy way using Brackets path finder tools.

If you can't find your assignment, you can [download a
copy]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/links-warmup.pdf) to use for this activity.
