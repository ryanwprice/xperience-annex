## Try it out

Grab the [links-followup.zip]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/links-followup.zip) and try to
build the links the easy way using the tutorials below.

If you can't find your assignment, you can [download a
copy]({{ site.github.url }}/pdf/links.pdf) to use for this activity.

## Now for the easy way!

Now that you've struggled with relative paths, let's do things the easy
way!

It is important to know how to figure out relative paths, but sometimes
our head's aren't screwed on tight, or we simply don't have time or
patience to work it out. Fortunately, Dreamweaver has some easy ways to
take care of linking pages, files, and images for us without the
headaches of path structures.

I could ramble on here and write out boring instructions with screen
grabs of Dreamweaver, or I can post an Adobe-created video to help outâ€¦
