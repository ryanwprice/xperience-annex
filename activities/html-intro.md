title: Introduction to HTML & CSS
---

This is a great reference tool when you're stuck trying to figure out what's what!

In the [html-intro.zip]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/html-intro.zip) file there are two HTML files, one without CSS, one with CSS, to help you see how things work under the hood.

The files are commented like crazy so you can see what is going on, so be sure to look at the code in Dreamweaver, not just in the browser.

Please pay attention to the fact that the CSS is part of the HTML file. This is not standard practice, and is not acceptable for your class assignments. This has been done for this activity only to reduce the number of files you have to deal with.
