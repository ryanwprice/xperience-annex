Instructions

Using the [oh-my.zip]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/oh-my.zip), embed an image, audio clip, and video clip into the HTML page with the following requirements:

- Audio & video should not start automatically.
- Audio & video should have a set of playback controls
- Video should have a placeholder image
- Image should have an appropriate alt element.

Don't worry about things looking pretty, we can style things later on. This exercise is just to get a handle on the embed codes necessary for the various formats.

If you get stuck, crack open the textbook for some help. Worst case, youâ€™ve always got me!
