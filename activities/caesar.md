## Overview

There are lots of different types of content in HTML, such as headlines, paragraphs, and more.

Take the [handout](/assets/caesar-salad.pdf) provided in class of Jamie Oliver's Caesar Salad recipe and mark it up. Use a pen, pencil, marker, whatever, and indicate what each piece of text is in HTML code.

When you are finished, put your name at the top, and hand it in!

It doesn't matter how you mark it up, as long as you are clear about which piece of text is which!

## Checklist

- Have you marked up every piece of text?
- Did you check it against the sample html file reviewed in class?
- Is your name on it?
