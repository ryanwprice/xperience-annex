## A Wire—what???

A wireframe is basically a blueprint of what a web site should look like with no graphics. A wireframe helps the designer clarify what needs to be on the page, making sure that there is a place for each component.

Location, size, and proximity are the key considerations for a
wireframe. Just like with a blueprint for a house, we need to think about how things fit together— what we need, where the items should be and how big they should be. Example: Do we need one bathroom or two?

Beside the kitchen or the bedrooms? Is it big enough for someone to use the washroom easily?

“A wireframe is a visualization tool for presenting proposed functions, structure and content of a Web page or Web site.”

## Activity

Take a look at the included [PDF wireframe]({{site.github.url}}/assets/wireframe.pdf) and evaluate it for its effectiveness. Based on the lecture, what has been done incorrectly in this wireframe (there are several things that are less than ideal here)?

Point out _at least_ three errors and discuss how they can be improved to make the wireframe more useful for the client.
