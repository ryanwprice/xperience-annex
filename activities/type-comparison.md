title: Type Comparison
---

Craigslist and Kijiji both focus on online classifieds, but look very different from each other. Spend some time reviewing both sites ([craigslist.org](http://craigslist.org) and [kijiji.ca](http://kijiji.ca)) and think about type on the Web and the typographic pros and cons for each site (please focus on the type, not the other graphics, design elements, etc.). 

Decide which site uses type more effectively, overall, and defend your decision using the design principles outlined in the lecture. Post your argument to the Discussion board and highlight _at least_ three reasons why you chose that site as the winner.

Feel free to also make some suggestions as to how to improve the “losing” site.

## Tips

- Try searching for some bargains with both sites (Need a new bike? Looking for concert tix? Look for something you might actually use the sites for!)
- Focus on the type, not the other graphics, design elements, etc..
