A classic example of a table that needs to be easy-to-read is the arrivals/departures listings at the airport. Thousands of people rely on these tables every day, and if they aren’t easy to read and understand, they simply aren’t doing their job!

For this activity, you will be creating an online flight schedule: Grab the [tables.zip]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/tables.zip) file which contains an Excel spreadsheet of the flights needed for the assignment, as well as an HTML template with folder structure and blank HTML and CSS files to use as a jumping-off point.

## Instructions

1. Structure the table: Build your table structure in HTML using the appropriate tags: `<thead>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, etc.. You will need columns for _Airline_, _Flight_ _Number_, _Destination_, _Time_, and _Status_. There are 10 flights listed in the table.

2. Add Table Head Content: Create `<th>` cells for Airline, Flight Number, Destination, Time, and Status.

3. Add Table Body Content: Using the Flight Schedule spreadsheet, fill in the data for the 10 flights listed in the file.

4. Style Your Table: Before you dive into the CSS, make sure that you spend some time looking at other online examples. Check out [Toronto Pearson Airport](http://www.torontopearson.com/en/flights/schedules/?DEV_fs_term=), [LAX](http://www.airport-la.com/lax/arrivals), the [Cultured Code Status](http://culturedcode.com/status/) page, the textbook’s [Table Styles](http://htmlandcssbook.com/extras/table-styles/), or any others you can find.

Create an aesthetically pleasing and useable design by adding details like zebra striping (alternating row colours), borders, differentiate the header content. Also, consider colour, typographic style, and alignment.
