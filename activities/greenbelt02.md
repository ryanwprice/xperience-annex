Now that you’ve fixed the HTML in the Greenbelt 01 exercise, it’s time to add some style!

The HTML tags are perfect in this exercise. All you need to do is edit the CSS file. **Do not make changes to the tags.**

## WHAT’S WRONG WITH THIS CODE?

In the [greenbelt02.zip]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/greenbelt02.zip) file there is a completed HTML file for you, just in case you didn’t catch every little error in the code last week. Your job is to adjust the CSS file (not the HTML!) to make the webpage match the mockup provided.
