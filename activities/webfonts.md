This is your opportunity to apply special typefaces that are hosted by
Google's webfont service

## Exercise:

### 1. Style your doc

Using the index.html and style.css files in [webfonts.zip](/assets/webfonts.zip), add some CSS properties to improve the default typography. Consider size, spacing, colour, etc. and create a design that helps improve the communication of the document while looking good as well.

Before you get going, don't forget to to to `Site > New Site` in Dreamweaver to setup the site.

### 2. Add a webfont

Visit the [Google web fonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts) site and select one of the 651 (at the time of writing) fonts available. Click the "Quick-use" button.

### 3. Add the code

Add a stylesheet link to request the desired webfont. It should look like the one below and you can find it under Step 2 of the Quick-use: "Choose the character sets you want"

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Font+Name">

### 4. Style an Element

Whether you have selected the a headline or paragraph text, you need to apply the font to your CSS file. Take a look at the example below for help

    h1{ font-family: 'Google Webfont name', serif; }

### 5. One more thing!

Now that you've added a webfont, why not add some CSS3? Give the text-shadow property a whirl (as seen below):
