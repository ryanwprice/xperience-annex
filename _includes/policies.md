<h3>Academic Regulations (Attendance, Coursework, Tests/Exams)*</h3>

<p>In accordance to <a href="http://academiccalendars.romcmaster.ca/content.php?catoid=7&amp;navoid=559">McMaster University’s General Academic Regulations</a>, “it is imperative that students make every effort to meet the originally scheduled course requirements and it is a student’s responsibility to write examinations as scheduled.” Therefore, all students are expected to attend and complete the specific course requirements (i.e. attendance, assignments, and tests/exams) listed in the course outline on or by the date specified.  </p>

<ol>
<li>Students who need to arrange for <strong>coursework accommodation</strong>, as a result of medical, personal or family reasons, must contact the <strong>course instructor</strong> within five (5) days of the originally scheduled due date. </li>
<li>Students who need to arrange for <strong>a deferred test and/or examination</strong> must contact the <strong>program manager</strong> within five (5) days of the originally scheduled test/exam</li>

<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>

<p>You are expected to exhibit honesty and use ethical behaviour in all aspects of the learning process. Academic credentials you earn are rooted in principles of honesty and academic integrity. </p>

<p>Academic dishonesty is to knowingly act or fail to act in a way that result or could result in unearned academic credit or advantage. This behaviour can result in serious consequences, e.g. the grade of zero on an assignment, loss of credit with a notation on the transcript (notation reads: “Grade of F assigned for academic dishonesty”), and/or suspension or expulsion from the university. </p>

<p>It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes academic dishonesty. For information on the various types of academic dishonesty, please refer to the Academic Integrity Policy, located at <a href="http://www.mcmaster.ca/academicintegrity">http://www.mcmaster.ca/academicintegrity</a></p>

<p>The following illustrates only three forms of academic dishonesty: </p>

<ol>
<li>Plagiarism, e.g. the submission of work that is not one’s own or for which other credit has been obtained. </li>
<li>Improper collaboration in group work. </li>
<li>Copying or using unauthorized aids in tests and examinations. </li>
</ol>
