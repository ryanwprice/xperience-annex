Restaurant Web sites stink (well, most of them)! Your job is to create a good one.

The restaurant can have any theme you want (Mexican, Thai-fusion, All-you-can-eat, etc.), but it must be completely made up. Do **not** re-invent _McDonalds_ or _The Keg_, etc.. You will need lots of design components for this assignment—a logo, a menu, images of food, and so on. 

The logo must be designed by you, because, after all, this place doesn't exist... yet. Other images may be from the Internet, just please ensure you that you cite them on an invisible layer (named citations) in your design file. The menu may be completely made up or adapted from an existing restaurant, but it should be fitting to your establishment.

Think about what elements are relevant to your business and the design challenge and apply them appropriately. The company, it's brand, and all other facets you incorporate into the design are completely up to you.

Design a Web page that presents the content in a visually interesting way, while at the same time creating a clear sense of hierarchy and order. Work with style sheets to test different type treatments quickly and consistently. The hierarchical structure is completely up to you, but be prepared to justify your decisions.

In addition to creating a logical and legible order, seek to impart the information with a distinctive and engaging visual identity. Employ scale, placement, alignment, type style, and other cues to create visual order.

The Web site will consist of only one page; all information must be located somewhere on that page. Even though this is a one-page site, it doesn't necessarily mean that you don't need some kind of navigation—people don't want to scroll through a long site to find what they need when they can click a link.

A common grid used on the Web is the 960 grid. You must use this grid (12, 16, or 24 columns). There are templates for InDesign and Illustrator available on Elara so that you don't have to start from scratch. The templates are not very tall, so feel free to make the page longer to fit all of your content, but be sure not to extend the width of the template.

All imagery used should be saved in an optimal format for the type of image (gif, png, or jpg), in RGB, and sized appropriately. Filenames should be web-ready as well (this means all lowercase, no spaces).

As you begin to design your website, think about what the typical visitor to your site wants in a design. [The Oatmeal](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/restaurant_website) comic below is a good case study.

_Note: You are creating a PDF mockup, not an actual working Web site._ Your finished design should look like the real thing, but it will not be functional (ie: clickable links, etc.)._

## Submission

Create a folder entitled `Lastname-Firstname-webgraphics` and include both the source file (`indd` or `ai`) and an exported PDF (`Lastname-Firstname-webgraphics.pdf`). You should also include a subfolder entitled `images` with all of your web-optimized images for the site. Submit the folder to Ryan’s Hand In folder.
