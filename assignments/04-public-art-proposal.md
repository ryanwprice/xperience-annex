## Introduction

Sheridan College has (hypothetically) announced an initiative that invites students to submit proposals for “art interventions” that will be installed in and around the Trafalgar campus.

The art interventions should use 3-dimensional objects (sculptures), possibly augmented by 2-dimensional expression (large-scale graphics), and are to be environmental in scale — that is, they should seek to transform and change the public's perception of an entire space such as a lobby, corridor, courtyard, parking lot, etc. Of particular interest are the 'left over' spaces around the school (such as the paved or grass areas in between buildings) that are currently neglected and void of interest.

In terms of ‘style’, the artwork should explore abstract modernism. Choose one of the following 3 themes:

- Planar compositions that explore aspects of space and time.
- Stick constructions whose form are both object and enclosure.
- Block assemblages that depict the world in '8-bit' resolution.

Use InDesign (or Illustrator) to compose the layout of a Proposal Document as a multi-page spread designed for print. The images and graphics depicting your art installation must be produced using digital media (Photoshop, Illustrator, SketchUp, etc.), with the exception of handsketched line drawings, which may be scanned in and then rendered digitally.

Experimentation with and employment of 3D software (Sketchup, Blender, 3D Studio, etc.) is strongly encouraged.

You may work in teams of two.

## Deliverables

The requirements for the Proposal Document are as follows:

One 11" &times; 17" printed page that should include:

- project title & subtitle(s)
- suggested location(s)
- artist name(s)
- month/year of production
- inspirational graphics
- perspective image (sketch, rendering, collage, or combination thereof) of the installation from the vantage point of the intended audience
- additional diagrams or sketches that augment and/or clarify visual aspects of the work
- textual descriptions that convey the intent, ideas and narratives inherent in the proposed intervention

## Submission

Printed Proposal Document, as specified above.

Additionally, you must upload your final project to Slate. The project should be contained in a ZIP file named `LastName-FirstName-proposal` and should include the following:

- One packaged InDesign folder (File > Package) that contains the InDesign file along with all linked images and fonts.
- One High Quality Print PDF file

If working in teams of two, please use `Lastname-Lastname-proposal`

Only relevant files should be in the folder. This means no unnecessary source files, etc.&ndash;keep the file as small as possible for your own sanity when uploading.
