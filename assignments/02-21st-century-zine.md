Now that you have spent some time dealing with the printed page, lets turn the page into something digital–something interactive. Let's build a zine for the 21st Century!

_What's a zine!?!_

> A zine is usually a non–commercial, non professional publication, kind of like a magazine but with a twist. The main difference between a magazine and a zine is that zines are not out there to make a profit but, rather, to add other, often unheard voices into the mix. Zines are usually made out of interest and passion and are often self-published by the writer/artist/creator.

> &hellip;

> Many of the first zines were science fiction fanzines created in the 1920s and 1930s through which science fiction fans would speculate and discuss various topics. Later on, in the 1950s with the Beatnik era, poets and other artists would make small leaflets with their poems as means of self promotion. Many avant-garde movements, including the Dadaists and the Situationists, also self-published pamphlets and manifestos. The 70s saw punk zines being created as part of the punk movement and in the spirit of the DIY (do it yourself) culture that came along with it. In the 80s, a zine called Factsheet 5 began reviewing zines, thus creating a somewhat more formal zine scene. In the 90s, many zines were made as part of the Riot Grrl movement.

## The Zine

Create a zine about something that interests you by incorporating text and image as you see fit. Images can be anything you want–artwork, photographs, even borrowed graphics from the Web (cited, of course). The aesthetic doesn't have to be your "typical" cut & paste zine–it can be more "designy", a photo book, graphic novel, choose-your-own-adventure, children's book,or anything you think would lend itself well to an interactive PDF.

The zine about must be _at least_ 12 pages long, otherwise, format is up to you. The finished document must be a digital interactive PDF (images @72DPI, RGB colours, links, etc.).

### Design considerations

Beyond the standard images &amp; text, some other aspects of the catalogue should not be overlooked. You may wish to include:

- Cover page(s)
- Table of contents
- Page numbers
- Page bleeds (there is no cropping here)
- Links

## Animated GIF

Once your zine is complete, you will also create a separate Animated GIF that can be used to advertise your zine on Web sites, discussion boards, even in email. The animated GIF should be no larger than 600px &times; 600px and between 2–12 seconds long. The style of the GIF is completely up to you (frame animation, cinemagraph, etc.), but should be aesthetically cohesive with the zine.

The Animated GIF and zine are weighted equally, so do not leave the GIF to become an "afterthought". 

## Submission

Submit the interactive PDF and a copy of the animated GIF as a ZIP to Slate with the filename `Lastname-Firstname-zine.zip`
