Now that you have spent the term experimenting with overarching concepts of type, hierarchy, grid, and image, it is time to focus on the details. 

Collect/document 24 designed objects from your surroundings.

Your collection must be well-considered and thoughtful in nature (for example, a collection of items that are merely pink is not sufficient). There must be a conceptual or thematic thread that ties all of the objects together that is more rich.

_None of the objects may be owned by you._

## Exhibition Catalogue

Curate an exhibition catalogue, including explanatory text, object description (example: dimensions, weight, media, etc.) and image(s) for each designed object. 

The catalog must be _at least_ 16 pages long (and the page count _must_ be a multiple of 4). Otherwise, format is up to you. The finished document must be a digital interactive PDF (images @72DPI, RGB colours, links, etc.).

All photos and artwork (other than the objects themselves) must be your own.

### Design considerations

Beyond the standard images &amp; text, some other aspects of the catalogue should not be overlooked. You may wish to include:

- Cover page(s)
- Table of contents
- Page numbers
- Page bleeds

## Animated GIF

Once your catalogue is complete, you will also create an Animated GIF that can be used for Web promotions such as email marketing for prospective clients and art collectors. The animated GIF should be no larger than 600px &times; 600px and showcases _at least_ one of the objects in the collection. The style of the GIF is completely up to you (frame animation, cinemagraph, etc.), but should be aesthetically cohesive to the catalogue.

The Animated GIF and Exhibition Catalogue are weighted equally, so do not leave the GIF to become an "afterthought". 

## Submission

Submit the interactive PDF and a copy of the animated GIF to Slate with the filenames `Lastname-Firstname-catalogue.pdf` and `Lastname-Firstname-catalogue.gif`.
