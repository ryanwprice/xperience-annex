> “Indeed, the elements and functionality of a finished website design should work as a single cohesive unit, so that: Users are pleased by the design but drawn to the content.”
> —The Principles of Beautiful Web Design, Jason Beaird

The first half of this course introduced you to the basic language of the web (HTML and CSS) and the foundational concepts of structuring and presenting content. In the second half of this course, you brought this knowledge to bear on the Web design process – from concept to creation, bringing in aspects of usability, accessibility, and design to create a finished Web site.

## Assignment overview

For your final course assignment, you will create a complete Web site about something of special interest to you—a great book, a favourite pastime or hobby, someone important to you, or even your cat—if you care about the topic, the site will reflect your passion for the topic.

The site should:

- Possess a well-developed unified design that compliments the topic of choice.
- Include the basic structure and typical components required in Web pages.
- Demonstrate effective use of the principles and elements of web design (including a grid system)
- Contain a minimum of 4 webpages.

## Process

Start by selecting the topic of your site. From there, create four page ideas that you could create. No formal hierarchy is required, just a list in your mind will suffice!

Example: Let’s say I choose my favourite book. Some pages I could include in the site are:

- A review of the book
- A list and description of characters
- A page linking to stores that sell it online
- Photos of the different print editions/covers or photos of the page spreads if they are aesthetically interesting
- A sample of the writing (properly cited!)
- A bio of the author
- An FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) page about the plot

Once you have your content figured out, you will need to design the basic layout for the site. Some content may need a different layout than other pages (i.e. A photo gallery versus a text-heavy page), but things like the header, footer, navigation, etc., should stay the same on each page. Draw out a wireframe (or two). These don’t need to be formal documents, either; wireframing will help you save time during the coding process if you have the layout and design worked out.

As you draw out your wireframes, think about what components you actually need not the page. Below is a list of things that may (or may not) be relevant to your site:

### Header

- Logo
- Navigation?

### Body Content

How is the content separated?
What headings and subheadings will be included?
Will there be a sidebar?

### Footer

- Copyright info
- Terms and conditions
- Privacy Policy
- Social Media links

Once you have the layout(s) roughed out with a wireframe, it’s time to start thinking about design. Below are some things you should consider before getting into the code:

- What fonts will I use? (Pairing two contrasting fonts is a good way to create aesthetic interest as well as enforce hierarchy).
- What colours will I use? (Create a simple colour palette of 3-4 complimentary colours to your topic. Don’t pick colours simply because “they look nice”)
- What images should I use? (The textbook has a great resource online about [Choosing Images For Your Site](http://htmlandcssbook.com/extras/choosing-images-for-your-site/) 

As you work on the aesthetic aspects of the site, consider the following to help you refine your design decisions:

- Who is the intended audience of the site?
- What is the look?
- What is the feel?

Now that you have a good sense of what your finished site will look like in your mind, it is time to start coding (finally)! Use this [site template]({{ site.github.url}}/assets/assignment-template.zip) to get you started.

Start by framing the site out: divs, header, footer, content, etc.. 

Once you have the basic framework laid out, start at the top of the page, and work your way down the page: logo, navigation, h1, etc..

Build one complete page and polish it to perfection, tweaking the CSS and HTML until you have the ‘perfect’ page. Save it! You’ve been saving often anyways, right!?!

Now save a copy of that page as the second page in your site and edit the content to fit. Repeat this process until you have all four pages complete.

## Submission

This assignment is due at the end of class **{{ page.duedate }}** and is worth **{{ page.weighting }}** of your final grade.

<p>Zip the relevant files and upload them to the class <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/request/ihU2LSIIOBJiI7Qigont" target="_blank">Dropbox</a></p>

All files for the Web page should be placed within a root folder and managed appropriately (styles & image folders, etc.). The folder name should include your full name and the title of submission.

Example: `jane-doe-website`

Review the [rubric]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/website-rubric.pdf) before submitting to ensure you have met all of the objectives! A **deduction of 25% will applied to the final grade for every missing page** (Example: If only two pages are submitted, a deduction of 50% will be given. A grade of 80/100 would be reduced to 30%).
