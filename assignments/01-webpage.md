## Overview

In the first few weeks of this course you learned about the principles of Web design and how to author web pages using HTML and CSS.

In this assignment, you will be challenged to apply your design skills to a common document type – a recipe. Menus, resumes and recipes are familiar and formulaic document types that have recognizable components. For instance, culinary recipes will always include the name of the dish, a list of ingredients, preparation time and preparation steps. When we look at a recipe, we expect to see these components and we expect to see them presented in a logical order.

Although the content and form of a recipe is somewhat prescribed, the design varies in each cookbook or recipe webpage. 

## Assignment

Build a recipe webpage that demonstrates:

-   Effective use of the principles of web design
-   A well-developed unified visual style (including image, type, colour)
-   Hierarchical arrangement of content by making effective typographical choices and by authoring well-structured HTML markup
-   A consideration for accessibility
-   Appropriate embedding of metadata

## Process

1.  Research the design and visual style of recipes on the web and in books. Find a minimum of 3 examples of design elements that inspire you and that you would consider adapting for your own webpage.
2. Find a minimum of 2 unique images to use in your recipe webpage. You will be required to use at least one background image and at least one image that will integrated with the content of your webpage. Ensure that the images are available for use and do not have any copyrights attached. If they do, make sure you cite the source! (If you need help assessing this, please ask!)
3. Download the [site template]({{ site.github.url}}/assets/assignment-template.zip) included. Code an accessible and semantic HTML Web page using the included [recipe text]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/recipe.rtf).  Make sure to include:
- Citations for any copyrighted content that requires attribution. A source link for the recipe is included in the text. Image citations (links to the original) can be added as a `title` in the `<img>` tag.
- Descriptive metadata for your content and images
4. Create an appropriate and aesthetic design for the recipe using images and CSS. Make sure you include a Google Web font in your design!
5. Review the rubric before submitting to ensure you have met all of the objectives!!

## Checklist

Before submitting your assignment, please review the following checklist:

- My recipe has all of the required basic recipe components: recipe name, list of ingredients and preparation steps, etc.
- My webpage images have been edited and saved appropriately for the Web.
- All my images have alt tags 
- My images are sized appropriately for the page
- The information on the webpage has been given hierarchical structure by using the appropriate HTML elements. The content has been organized into ordered lists, unordered lists, headings, paragraphs, and tables where appropriate. 
- All the required metadata has been entered correctly
- At least one image has been inserted into the page using the `<img>` element. 
- At least one background image has been inserted into the page using the `background-image` property. 
- Added a link using the `<a>` element with proper citation text for the recipe
- Source Formatting (indents/nesting) has been applied to the HTML & CSS to make the code easier to read. 
- All CSS styles have been defined in a separate .css file – CSS is not defined in the HTML file. 
- At least one Google web font has been used. 
- All fonts have been defined in a font stack (list of fonts). See [http://cssfontstack.com/](http://cssfontstack.com/) for some inspiration.
-  All of my files are in a root folder. 
-  I have moved my folder to another spot on my hard drive and viewed the Web page in the browser to ensure that the webpage is working properly. Hint: if things look wrong, chances are you have an issue with a relative link(s)
- I have reviewed the [rubric]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/webpage-rubric.pdf)
