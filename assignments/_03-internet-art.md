## Overview

The Internet is a network of web pages and sites that allow us to communicate with one another. You can broadcast a message, or view the messages of others. These messages can be in the form of text, audio, video/motion graphics, and still images. We can create art by manipulating these communications.

An Internet artist does not need to spend a lot of money on supplies (if any). An Internet artist does not need expert programming skills (or any at all). An Internet artist simply needs a good idea, and a firm understanding of the medium s/he will be using.

Crowdsourcing, subversion, and manipulation are tools an artist can apply to his or her work on the Internet.

The goal is to use the Internet to create an original piece of art, using the skills and tools at your disposal. The final piece must be publicly accessible via the Internet and must create some kind of interaction. The Internet is your oyster as you work on this project. The final artwork is completely up to you, but _please_ make sure you can justify your work and explain the ideas and meaning behind the work.

You may work in teams of two.

_A quick note about copyright_. Due to the nature of the project copyright images may be used (example: Instagram pics, Google Maps images, etc.). You may appropriate these images as necessary for the purpose of the assignment. That said, some form of citation—a link to the the original artist/image would suffice—is required. If you suggest that the individual artwork(s) is/are yours, and not created by someone else, you may risk crossing the line into copyright and plagiarism charges. If at any point, you are unsure of what is fair or appropriate for the assignment, please ask your instructor!

## Submission

### Concept Proposal

You must provide notes, sketches, inspirational images, work in progress, etc. to help convey your idea to the instructor. The instructor must approve your concept before final submission. 

Concepts will be reviewed after the critique in week 08 and counted towards your in-class assignments mark.

### Final Submission

Email [{{ site.email }}]({{ site.email }}) with the Subject "Internet Art Assignment DSGN27545" (the subject line is very important as this is what I will use to filter emails to find your assignment!).

The body of the email should be a link to your Internet Art assignment, followed by a brief description of the assignment (just a paragraph or two), explaining the meaning/symbolism behind the assignment.

If you are working in pairs, both of you must submit an email with the above requirements.
