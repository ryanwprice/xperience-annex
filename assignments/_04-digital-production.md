Now that you have spent the term experimenting with overarching concepts of type, hierarchy, grid, and image, it is time to focus on the details. Below are two projects, but you only need to complete _one_ of them! Pick the project that inspires you the most.

There are two re-design projects available for you: A package redesign for Dr. Bronner's Magic Soap, and a boarding pass redesign for Delta Airlines.

Details make the difference from the design being good versus great! What is the most important thing to display in each design? Is the barcode scannable? Is a bleed necessary? How will the design be printed? Every little detail matters, and you need to be able to justify your decisions to the client! Before you start designing, think about how the design will actually be used. What is most important to the person picking up the bottle of soap, or receiving the boarding pass?

No matter which project you choose, all artwork (unless supplied by Ryan) must be your own!

## Project 1: Dr. Bronner's Magic Soap

### Overview

![Dr. Bronner's Magic Soap](/img/bronner.gif)

People love Dr. Bronner's magic soap. It's fair trade and has no detergents or foaming agents. The bottle is even 100% post-consumer recycled plastic. 

Dr. Bronner's Magic Soap stands out as something unique—just look at that label! Designer's love the design (or rather lack thereof): "That dense manifesto where capital letters and mantras run wild. Where Helvetica and Times are knocked-out, justified, squished, squeezed, and wrapped all the way around the bottle, with as many as 250 characters per line."

Your job is to design a new label for the 32-ounce bottle of Doctor Bronner's Magic Peppermint Soap. You must use the original text and dimensions; no additional text please! The bar code and third-party logos are available on Elara in Ryan's handout folder. You must use all the supplied graphics, but you may also add your own.

Dr. Bronner wants to see two versions of the final design: one with a new image-centric design, and one that is more in line with the current brand thinking (typography only).

The designs must include the following:

- Label size: 9.5" x 6.375"
- Oregon Tilth Certified Organic logo
- CCIC Leaping Bunny logo
- IMO Fair Trade / Fair for Life logo
- UPC-A barcode: 0 18787 77532 5

## Project 2: Boarding Pass

### Overview

![Actual boarding pass](/img/boarding-pass.gif)

If you have ever taken a plane to go on vacation, you know how important a boarding pass is—that little slip of paper is worth a small fortune and determines your fate (or at least where you will arrive)—it's kind of a big deal.

The thing about these passes is that they are cryptic messages, poorly designed, especially for people who only go to the airport once a year (or less) for their summer vacay!

Your job is to design a new boarding pass for Delta Airlines. You must include all of the information listed on the original boarding pass (text, logo, at least one barcode), but the dimensions are up to you. The text and graphics are available on Elara in Ryan's handout folder. You must use all of the supplied graphics, but you may also add your own.

Delta Airlines wants to see three versions of the final design, each one should be distinctly different from the others. One of the three should be type-only (no graphics other than the required ones).

The designs must include:

- Delta logo
- Flight number
- Departure date and boarding time
- Departure gate
- Departure airport
- Destination airport
- Seat number
- Boarding pas number
- Document title
- Barcode(s)
- Passenger's name (you!)

## Submission

Submit a final PDF to my Hand In folder on Elara as **Lastname-Firstname-Bronner.pdf** or **Lastname-Firstname-Delta.pdf**  with with all of the necessary bleeds and crop marks. All designs should be in the same PDF.

Please bring a printed (1:1 scale) copy of your project to the critique for submission.
