You are a crazy Mad Scientist who has just mastered the art of time travel! What's even better is: it can be done with an iPhone (5s + up)!

You need to design a new iOS time travel app. When activated, you can use the app to literally travel in time. Design a user interface and logo for the app for iOS.

The app name is completely up to you. The logo must be completely designed by you, because, after all, this is your app. 

How the app works is your call&ndash;you are the inventor&ndash;but the interface should adhere to Apple's [iOS Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH66-SW1).  Images (if necessary) may be from the Internet, just _please_ ensure that you cite them on an invisible layer (named citations) in your design file.

There is no set number of "screens" for the app, but the ability to travel through time must be intuitive by _everyone_ who uses it.

Design a mockup that presents the content in a visually interesting way, while at the same time creating a clear sense of hierarchy and order. Work with style sheets to test different type treatments quickly and consistently. The hierarchical structure is completely up to you, but be prepared to justify your decisions.

In addition to creating a logical and legible order, seek to impart the information with a distinctive and engaging visual identity. Employ scale, placement, alignment, type style, and other cues to create visual order.

Once you have created the icon and mockup, you will assemble it into a 1-page letter-sized PDF showcasing the app. Think of it as a sales sheet for investors. You may include any information you wish on this page (features, pricing, etc.). Take a look at the App Store for an idea of what content you may wish to include.

Using your amazing iOS app, I have traveled into the future to find an example of the finished assignment. It's not pretty, but it gets the job done!

_Note: this example meets the assignment requirements, but it is not well done. This is a quick draft to help you get a better sense of what is expected in the final design_


## Resources

 - [iOS 10 GUI](http://facebook.design/ios10.html) &ndash;Feel free to use elements from this to mockup your interface
 - [iOS App Icon Template](https://applypixels.com/template/ios-app-icon/)
 - [iOS Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH66-SW1)

## Deliverables

 - 1-page letter-sized (8.5" &times; 11") PDF showcasing the app (including the design, interface, product blurb, etc.) that includes:
 	- iOS icon for your app
 	- _at least_ 1 iPhone interface mockup

## Submission

Create a folder entitled `Lastname-Firstname-timetravel` and include both the source files (`indd`, `ai`, and/or `psd`) and an exported PDF of the final designs (`Lastname-Firstname-timetravel.pdf`). Submit the folder as a `ZIP` file to Slate by the start of class.
