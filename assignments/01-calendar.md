## Overview

Using only images and material created by you, design a letter sized (8.5" &times; 11") calendar for print with InDesign. You are expected to use a master page and guides for your initial layout, as well as paragraph & character styles and swatches to manage the appearance. The calendar does not have to be based on months, but should cover at least an entire calendar year.

**Pro Tip:** Make the calendar for next year and you've got gifts and Etsy items ready to go!

Imagery should be your own (no Google searches, please) and should be edited appropriately for print (300 DPI, CYMK).

Creativity and well-planned concepts will be rewarded.

## Submission

Create a folder entitled `Lastname-Firstname-Calendar` and include both the digital Package (your InDesign assets) and an exported PDF (`Lastname-Firstname-Calendar.pdf`) with the printer marks included. Submit the folder as ZIP to Slate.
