## Course Description

This course incorporates the foundational principles of web design with experiential activities relevant to the process of designing, producing static Web sites. These principles form the basis for knowledge and skills threaded throughout the subsequent program courses. The importance of design elements, accessibility, usability and functionality will be examined to demonstrate how they affect visual and text content. Application activities involving HTML5, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and web design industry tools such as code editing and image manipulating software will launch the studentâ€™s professional portfolio project.

## Communication

I can be reached at [{{ site.email }}]({{ site.email }}) and will reply within 24 hours except on the weekends. 

Emailing me the night before an assignment is due, will not likely get the desired response time, so stay on top of work to ensure your questions do not go unanswered.

If you cannot make it to class, please let me know as soon as possible so we can make arrangements to get you caught up.
